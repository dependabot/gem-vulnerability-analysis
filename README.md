# Gem Vulnerability Analysis

The code behind the analysis in [this blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20190411015509/https://dependabot.com/blog/the-latest-dependency-version-is-probably-the-most-secure/).

All the fun stuff lives in [the Jupyter notebook][notebook].

## Running with Docker

1. Build the container:
   ```
   $ docker build -t gem-vulnerability-analysis .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```
   $ docker run --rm \
       -v "$(pwd)/notebooks:/home/jupyter/notebooks" \
       -p 8888:8888 \
       gem-vulnerability-analysis
   ```
3. Visit the URL that appears in stdout

## Running manually

Running with Docker is probably easier, but that's not your thing:

1. Install Ruby, [Jupyter][jupyter], and [iruby][iruby]
2. Navigate to the *notebooks* directory
3. Download and extract the contents of the [Rubysec advisory database][rubysec-db]
   to a sub-directory called *ruby-advisory-db-master*
4. Run `jupyter notebook`
5. Visit the URL that appears in stdout
